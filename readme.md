# TFS Todo

## Keep track of your active TFS work items

The other day I finally got tired of opening up Visual Studio, or navigating the TFS web interface, every time I wanted to check on my outstanding work items. It would be much easier to type a command and see what was on my list for the day.

So I wrote this tiny program to do just that. I can imagine many other features which could be added in "the future" (reassigning tasks, changing hours remaining, etc) but this solves my initial need well enough.

Putting it out there if anyone else finds it equally useful.
